# Reinforcement Learning Introduction - PuddleWorld  

## Motivation  

This project is an introductory effort to train an agent in the PuddleWorld environment using basic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.  The work was proposed by AMII (Alberta
Machine Intelligence Institute) as part of a friendly competition and learning opportunity in the lead-up to their Upper Bound AI conference in late May 2024.  The main objective 
is to become familiar with RL terminology, the main ways RL problems are tackled, the advantages and pitfalls of using RL, and where RL approaches may be applied.  Relevant 
libraries are also discovered, and an attempt to optimize hyperparameters is made using optuna.  

(More to come as work advances)  

## Note on files/repository  

The files in this repository primarily came from cloning AMII's repository for this competition.  Modifications to any notebooks, etc, were to be pushed to my own repo (this one). 
Many of the files found here are therefore not my creations.  I have so far created getting_started_development.ipynb, predictably, from getting_started.ipynb, which was kindly 
provided by AMII.  Files from other folders are required to run the code, such as environment configuration files, so it was simplest to keep the entire repo and add to the 
files once they resided on my own repo.  

The intention is to clean up the notebook files once a few approaches have shown some success.  The "...development" notebook is a first pass at basic RL libraries and methods.
