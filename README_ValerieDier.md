# Reinforcement Learning Introduction - PuddleWorld  

## Motivation  

This project is an introductory effort to train an agent in the PuddleWorld environment using basic reinforcement learning(RL) algorithms.  The work was proposed by AMII (Alberta
Machine Intelligence Institute) as part of a friendly competition and learning opportunity in the lead-up to their Upper Bound AI conference in late May 2024.  The main objective 
is to become familiar with RL terminology, the main ways RL problems are tackled, the advantages and pitfalls of using RL, and where RL approaches may be applied.  Relevant 
libraries are also discovered, and an attempt to optimize hyperparameters is made using optuna.  

(More to come as work advances)
